# CS50G-Helicopter
CS50's Introduction to Game Development Project 8: Helicopter 3D Game
## Goal
* Add Gems to the game that spawn in much the same way as Coins, though more rarely so. Gems should be worth 5 coins when collected and despawn when off the left edge of the screen.

* Fix the bug whereby the scroll speed of planes, coins, and buildings doesnâ€™t reset when the game is restarted via the space bar.
